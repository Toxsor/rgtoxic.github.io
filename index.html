  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Or is it???</p>
  <p>You will never know. Or you could just read the rest of this.</p>
  <p>But that takes too much effort, doesn't it?</p>
  <p>Well then why am I writing this if no one will read it? Is it a statement to the futility of creating a website and hoping someone will discover it?</p>
  <p>Well, maybe I should just stop writing then.</p>
  <p>Or, horrors upon horrors, I could make this a proper 'About Me' page. So here goes:</p>

    <figcaption><h3>Me</h3></figcaption>
   </figure>
    <p>I am a 15-year-old boy living in Santa Cruz, California. I have loved electronics and programming for several years and have aspired to build robots for a long time. I went to the Santa Cruz Waldorf School. My first robot was technically a project for school, although I was really just looking for an excuse to start building a robot. And then I decided I wasn't busy enough, so I started building websites for people. <em>Great idea</em>, right? Well, its worked out OK. It earns me money, which I need because whenever I think about <em>collage</em> I mentally scream. Or maybe literally. Ask my friends. Im not going to tell you. After collage I want to work for NASA, if the governement hasn't cut all funding yet. Or maybe SpaceX. I heard they are hiring.</p>
  <p>Does that satisfy your <em>arbitrary</em> need for an 'About Me' page? It had better because you're not getting anymore than that.</p>
  <h2 style="text-decoration: line-through">Contact Me</h2>
  <h2>Go away or I will use Comic Sans</h2>
  <p>Who idea was it to add a 'Contact Me' section? It's not like I'm a perticully sociable guy. Oh well, here goes:</p>
  <p>I don't live in the <em>Stone Age</em> so I do have an email. Crazy, right? I also use Github because it's better than opening up a folder and seeing my_project_first, my_project_oldest, my_project_old_old, my_project_old, my_project, my_project_new, my_project_new_new, my_project_newer, my_project_newest, my_project_extremely_new; because that is what happened when I built my first robot. I also created a profile on LinkedIn because apparently some collages will look at that. And if <em>wishes</em> were fishes then fishes would fly.</p>
  <p>Of course that makes sense. I don't know why you are looking at me funny. So in any case, there are links to my email, my Github account and my LinkedIn account in the footer of this page. If you can't see the footer, get a decent browser, you <em>Internet Explorer</em> Micro$oft lover! I am also on Facebook, but I use that rarely, and only to talk with friends, and I don't think you qualify. Sorry.<p>
